# Human Values Taxonomy

## Overview

This taxonomy of human values was developed to analyze the representation of values within Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) datasets. It is grounded in moral philosophy, axiology, and Science, Technology, and Society (STS) studies.

## Methodology

Our approach to constructing this taxonomy involved:
1. **Literature Review**: An integrated review across nine journal databases in human values-related disciplines.
2. **Paper Curation**: Curating papers describing human values from a social/ethical viewpoint.
3. **Categorization Process**:
   - **Bottom-up Grouping**: Grouping similar values into semantically coherent hierarchical categories.
   - **Qualitative Review**: Using hypernym-hyponym relationships for conceptual categorization.
   - **Ethical Verification**: Ensuring ethical paradigm alignment within each group.

## Taxonomy Structure

The taxonomy is structured around three major ethical frameworks:
- **A. Utilitarianism**
- **B. Deontological Ethics**
- **C. Virtue Ethics**

Within these frameworks, we've identified seven primary value categories:
- **Well-being/Peace**
- **Information Seeking**
- **Justice/Human Rights & Animal Rights**
- **Duty/Accountability**
- **Wisdom/Knowledge**
- **Civility/Tolerance**
- **Empathy/Helpfulness**

Each category contains multiple sub-values, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding and analyzing human values.

## Detailed Taxonomy

For a detailed breakdown of each category and its associated sub-values, please refer to the table in the main document. This table provides:
- The ethical framework for each category
- A description of each primary value category
- Examples of sub-values within each category

## Applications

This taxonomy serves as a foundation for:
- Analyzing RLHF datasets for the representation of human values
- Guiding the development of AI systems with a broader understanding of human values
- Facilitating discussions around ethics in AI and machine learning
